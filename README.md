# Gesture-controlled Speaker

As a team of music lovers, we decided that controlling household
speakers could be made more intuitive for users. The idea was to
only interact with the speaker as a natural extension of our bodily

movements. From there, we went to work prototyping a gesture-
controlled speaker.

Since MOSTEC was not able to meet in person in 2020 due to
COVID-19, we split up the work based on hardware. I was in
charge of wiring and programming the speaker while my
teammate programmed the glove responsible for detecting
movements.
The vibrating membrane (label 1) protrudes slightly from the top
of the 3D printed enclosure (label 2). As for the user interface, the
speaker prominently displays a TFT screen (label 3), which
contains icons for the volume, skip, and play states (label 4).
Our goal was to play, pause, skip, and alter the volume of the
songs within our chosen playlist (label 5).
This collaborative effort was thoroughly enjoyable, even when we
experienced hiccups along the way!
